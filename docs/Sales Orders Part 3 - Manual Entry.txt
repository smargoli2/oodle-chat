this is a demo for manual sales order entry into tile surround the pending application page and I have the page filter to this version of the rj11 and also set to the ship date is on May 16th after today so there are no orders that fill that come through these filters so now we can go to our sales order form here or also on the side menu there
 and I mean to leave the customer pops open will pick that customer and a notice and the top is subsidiary is already set you can change that and then I'll ask you to set it as the default if you want but it comes in as the default once I select the customer I'll see that the rep on files displayed and I get two buttons If I have permission I could even at it but everyone can view the details of the customer
 let's put in a customer po just anything
 shipping title pick Warehouse you'll see these two controls automatically were populated because if we look at our customer we have that on file if I were to change that on the Fly we would see that it would update and suffer example I changed that value then I'll see that it defaults to hear these are just the default that it pulls from the information you have on the customer of course you could change it for this Pacific Sales order if necessary
 and we have our shipping information so again
 any addresses you see her there can be multiple those will be available in this drop down so right now we have one and we pick our dates so we wanted to come to the filter on the pending application page so pick
 filling the last one delivery by date is not required so you don't have to fill it out
 hey I'm let's take a look at that model that we had
 so it'll automatically populate with the customer I remember that smacked a noodle so again if we look here we'll see it that the cti's map to that item number slept good popular automatically and if you have permission you can override it and change it for this specific order if necessary
 and I location you can either do auto or if there are purchase orders available for a manual manual location you can pick and will give you a list of appropriate purchase order number is not everything has to make sense that if you're allocating then purchase order is for this model etcetera so we know we just have four in the system let's go to auto allocation and we put in our room
 and the quantity
 here we have
 he's back validation has to be by 6
 Passover elevation and once a product is a model number is selected you get that icon there and you can pop that open for the availability chart so you have a quick way of seeing what you have available and there's your total
 these three options here let's go through them the Dropship option if I click that will remove the ship to and instead give us an address form for each line so it's going to be specific customer and I fill in the address and the plus sign here or here as another line and you'll see again for each line will get its own address if you get off the Dropship that goes away and I go back to the one ship to address for the overall sales order then we support the button here says ship to buy line item so we support allowing the ship to address to not be for the entire sales order but dictated on each individual line so if I click that button the ship to disappear from here from the parents from the sales order and instead is on each individual sales order line and here it says ship to buy sales order it does the reverse I can put it back and now it's the ship to his back here
 similarly with the dates that says ship dates by line item we support ship dates instead of being just for the entire sales with a refuge individual line so again it dropped takes the ship dates away from the overall sales order and places it on the line level so you can have different ones for each line
 I guess you can put it back you can have both
 and put them back so it is workable and support several variations
 and now that we have our sales order we maintain State on this page which means that if I go away from the page and come back it'll keep all the information I had if I want to start again then there's a reset form button you have the option to leave notes if you want let's go ahead and submit this sales order we confirm it automatically resets for the next one if you like it if you come back to our pending application we now have the order that we just put in and all the information is there any thank you
