this is an introduction to the new pending a location page so we're in the sale Section and right here pending a location as you can see let's go through briefly an overview of this page and in further tutorials will go into more detail into some of the features so what's an order a sales order is entered into the system the first place it will show up as this page and every hero is a sales order line in the columns we see the sales order number when it was made and by whom and we have our dates customer that's also a link you can pop open the details of a customer
 customer po where it's headed to hover over it it'll pop out and when you click you can copy the address if necessary
 what the customer ordered if it's a different model number than what we have on the sales order and it's been mapped to our model number but not every not at the door does not have to have it and then we have the actual model number and again that is a link to the regular dialogue
 a quantity and then we have available by so here we have a dash means it's not available at all and the next Colin tells us what's the quantity that's not available at the ship date of 426 is the entire quantity all 34 so just tell him we'll tell you how short you are if you have cancel the order at all or you can fill a partially and how much you could fill it
 where is here it says available by the actual ship date meaning on 426 All 48 pieces are the are available and therefore in the unavailable quantity those are those have a dash in here you have your totals at the bottom
 the color codes are red means there is no available inventory at all at the ship date green means it's able to be filled by at least one warehouse and then that green circle they're the number you see is how many warehouses can fill this order completely independently Serena we just have one the yellow means that there's no single Warehouse that can fill the entire order but if we combine at least two and maybe more then we could fill the order
 so if we open up this one here will see you that the order is 40 to 50 in California has 4223 a New York under 21 so each one on its own can fill up but if you combine the two we could
 and we have on the menu
 we'll discuss this in a later tutorial you can make a PR request for this item on the spot
 you can hide it again will discuss that in the different later tutorial you can look at the history and he edits the log of what took place what kind of changes were made to the sales order and cancel again we will discuss that in a l tutorial so let's take a look at the top are here this fucking here will allow us to Import Sales orders and we'll discuss that later and we have our custom filters you can search by the sales order number the model number customer customer piano and here we have a button that says Group by sales order if you see the rose are zebras striped white collar vs a grayish color so they're zebra stripes according to sales orders cuz again each row is a sales or a line so here we see that the two consecutive grey Rose cuz they're both from sales order 11009
 if I sort the table in any other order for example I decide to sort of by the model number and it goes off I can then easily group It Again by sales order and I'll give you back that
 that's Orting
 then here we have our a custom sliders these work in tandem when you can engaged one or more at a time and they're color-coded to the colors we mentioned before as if you just want to see what's available you can additionally see what's available by combo or just that one then only once I'm available and then we also have a required Warehouse of which there is none currently that is a customer can require that the good should be shipped from a specific chefman warehouse and here it it'll it'll show up in this area here letting you know that there's a requirement that you need to ship from a specific Warehouse
 I believe that covers the overview and in a further tutorials will get into the features that we've got over just briefly here and thank you
