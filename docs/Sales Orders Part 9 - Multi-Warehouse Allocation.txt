this is a demo for multi Warehouse a location so I'm not depending on location page and I have the available by combo slider is active and I have one sales order line here I could see us for fifteen thousand pieces and it's outlined in yellow because I can't fill it from one warehouse but I could combine if I open this up I can see that I do have options I have ten thousand plus from California I live in availability in New York in Houston as well
 so the fill this order I have the option of taking this single sales order line and allocating it over multiple warehouses so I see this after it here Mochi Warehouse allocation and then I get this you are if I would ever want to cancel it I see this cancel multi where else I would be patient and it goes back
 so the way it works is you get to choose how many warehouses you like to allocate from and how many pieces you like to allocate for each Warehouse so let's take ten thousand from California
 as I type the unallocated quality decreases so I have to I have to take another $5,000 into account in order to allocate this sales order line completely cover that it says add Warehouse
 so I know I'll go to New York and I'll take 3000 from there it's not drop down to 2,000 I'll add one more
 I'll go to Euston and get the remaining 2,000
 and now that I've satisfied the full quantity I get that filled Mark now when I go ahead and allocate here and confirm the sales order line remains intact it's still
 the same 50,000 pieces but it will be allocated from these three different warehouses with these three numbers now it's not just the don't it's not limited to just where it is only available at combo you can multiple you can allocate by multiple warehouses in that any point for example if I bring in these orders you can it's available in three places here you can mop you can multi Warehouse allocate the same way cuz it have to be the ones that are surrounded by the but yellow is just hearing you have to because you don't have a single Warehouse second thought
 so that is how you allocate multiple warehouses for a single sales order line thank you
