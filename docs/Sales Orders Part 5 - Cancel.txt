this is a demo for canceling a sales order line so I'm on depending allocation page and I have the page filter to set up sales order number 11025 and it has two lines so as we've seen in a previous tutorial I can edit the entire sales order mean I can pick it from this menu
 work on this menu
 it'll bring up the entire order and among the attics I can do is I can
 cancel that line and submit
 so that's one way to Conventional if you do it but as a shortcut there is a
 cancel an option on the menu and it'll ask you to confirm and that's a quick way to get rid of it but since the sales order had multiple lines the sales order Stills he has only one line now we open that up again
 what state has the one line
 if we cancel this last line as well then the entire sales are will go away because once there's no lines then there's no need for the sales order so if I cancel this one
 and confirm it is nothing left because sales order 11025 no longer exists
 okay that's how you can cancel a sales order line from the pending application page thank you
